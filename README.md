**DOOM: Squashware Edition** is a rework of the Doom Shareware IWAD
for embedded devices with restricted RAM and storage requirements. The
goal is to open the door to more "It Runs Doom!" projects.

What you will notice:
* Console Doom levels
* Restricted texture set
* Shorter sound effects
* Simplified (for size) title screen and intermission screen

What you're less likely to notice:
* Fewer animation frames and rotations on monsters
* Fewer animations on powerup animations and other items
