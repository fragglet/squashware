**DOOM: Squashware Edition** is a rework of the Doom Shareware IWAD
for embedded devices with restricted RAM and storage requirements. The
goal is to open the door to more "It Runs Doom!" projects.

[DOOF (Doom On One Floppy)](doof/) is a subproject that uses it to
build a version of shareware Doom that fits on one floppy disk (1.44 MB
3½" or 1.2 MB 5¼").

What you will notice:
* IWAD file size under 2MB
* Console Doom levels
* Restricted texture set
* Shorter sound effects
* Smaller font on the menu and intermission screen
* Simplified (for size) title screen and intermission screen

What you might be less likely to notice:
* Fewer animation frames and rotations on monsters
* Fewer animations on powerup animations and other items
* Shorter music tracks

## But wait, there's more!

Is a 2MB IWAD file still too large for you? The *silent* version removes
all the sound effects and is under 1.5MB. Perfect for when running Doom on
your hair dryer which doesn't have a speaker anyway.

But wait, there's more!

Is a 1.5MB IWAD file still too large for you? The *1-level* version
removes all except the first level of the game, and is under 800KB.
Perfect for when you just want to make a demo video of your port of Doom
to run on a dead badger, and you're not really serious about actually
playing the game all the way through.
