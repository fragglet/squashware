 About
 -----

 FastDoom is a Doom port for DOS, based on PCDoom by @nukeykt. The goal of
 this port is to make it as fast as posible for 386/486 personal computers

 https://github.com/viti95/FastDoom

 Motivation
 ----------
 
 Vanilla Doom required a powerful machine when it was released in 1993. 
 To run it properly, a 486 was mandatory, with at least 8 MB of RAM and a 
 Vesa Local Bus video card. A machine with those specs in 1993 was
 pretty damn expensive. The game itself run pretty slow on 386 PCs
 even at low detail and small screen size. I started this project in April 
 2020, after suffering the COVID-19 disease, nearly 27 years after release
 of Doom. I was very sick, and after the recovery I decided that somebody 
 had to make Doom run well on all 386 personal computers, and make their 
 owners proud of their machines.

 Minimum requirements
 --------------------
 
 CPU:        386SX at 16 MHz
 RAM:        4 MB (the executable runs even with less RAM, but it's 
             possible to see random crashes due to low RAM)
 Video card: Any ISA 8-bit Hercules, CGA, EGA or VGA video card. For cool
             graphics a fast VGA video card is recommended. Also MDA,
             Plantronics Colorplus and Sigma Color 400 cards are supported
 Controls:   Keyboard (mouse recommended)

 Supported WADS
 --------------

 The supported wads are the following:
    * DOOM.WAD -> DOOM Registered (3 episodes)
    * DOOM1.WAD -> DOOM Shareware (1 episode)
    * DOOMU.WAD -> Ultimate DOOM (4 episodes)
    * DOOM2.WAD -> DOOM II
    * PLUTONIA.WAD -> Final DOOM The Plutonia Experiment
    * TNT.WAD -> Final DOOM TNT Evilution 
    * FREEDM1.WAD -> FreeDoom Phase 1 (experimental)
    * FREEDM2.WAD -> FreeDoom Phase 2 (experimental)

 All of them must be the 1.9 version to work fine.

 Supported hardware
 ------------------
 
 CPU: Any x86 processor that supports 32 bit i386 instruction set
 Video cards: MDA, Hercules, CGA, EGA, VGA, Plantronics ColorPlus
              Sigma Color 400
 Sound cards: Sound Blaster, PC Speaker, Disney Sound Source,
              Gravis Ultrasound, Pro Audio Spectrum, COVOX LPT DAC,
              Creative Music System, Tandy 3-voice, OPL2LPT,
              OPL3LPT, Ensoniq Soundscape, Adlib
 Music cards: Sound Blaster (OPL2 and OPL3), Adlib, MIDI, Gravis Ultrasound
              Sound Blaster AWE32, OPL2LPT, OPL3LPT, AudioCD (MSCDEX),
              PCM music (through sound card), Ensoniq Soundscape

                   video card

 Limitations / Known bugs
 ------------------------
 * Gravis UltraSound cards require IRQ to be 7 or less, otherwise those
   cards won't work. This is a limitation of the Apogee Sound System.
 * Some executables will show snow issues on IBM CGA cards even if "-snow"
   parameter is used. This is due to technical limitations.
 * Showing FPS on a debug card can show weird values if a Sound Blaster
   card is used, and can cause sound issues. This is due to port 0x80 
   being also used for DMA transfers.

 PCM Music format
 ----------------

 PCM Music format is unsigned 8-bit PCM, and supports 11025, 22050 or 
 44100 Hz frequencies. 
 
 Use SOX to convert files to RAW format, for example:

 sox D_E1M1.ogg -r 44100 -e unsigned -b 8 -c 1 MUS_1.RAW
 
 Folders used for music are these:
 * Doom:     \MUSIC\DOOM1\MUS_*.RAW
 * Doom2:    \MUSIC\DOOM2\MUS_*.RAW
 * Plutonia: \MUSIC\PLUTONIA\MUS_*.RAW
 * TNT:      \MUSIC\TNT\MUS_*.RAW
