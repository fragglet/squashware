The loathsome spiderdemon that
masterminded the invasion of the moon
bases and caused so much death has had
its ass kicked for all time.

A hidden doorway opens and you enter.
You've proven too tough for Hell to
contain, and now Hell at last plays
fair -- for you emerge from the door
to see the green fields of Earth!
Home at last.

You wonder what's been happening on
Earth while you were battling evil
unleashed. It's good that no Hell-
spawn could have come through that
door with you ...
