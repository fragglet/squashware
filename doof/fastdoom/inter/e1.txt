Once you beat the big badasses and
clean out the moon base you're supposed
to win, aren't you? Aren't you? Where's
your fat reward and ticket home? What
the hell is this? It's not supposed to
end this way!

It stinks like rotten meat, but looks
like the lost Deimos base. Looks like
you're stuck on The Shores of Hell.
The only way out is through.

To continue the DOOM experience, play
The Shores of Hell and its amazing
sequel, Inferno!
