Time for a vacation. You've burst the
bowels of hell and by golly you're ready
for a break. You mutter to yourself,
Maybe someone else can kick Hell's ass
next time around. Ahead lies a quiet town,
with peaceful flowing water, quaint
buildings, and presumably no Hellspawn.

As you step off the transport, you hear
the stomp of a cyberdemon's iron shoe.
