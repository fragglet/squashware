You've done it! The hideous cyber-
demon lord that ruled the lost Deimos
moon base has been slain and you
are triumphant! But ... where are
you? You clamber to the edge of the
moon and look down to see the awful
truth.

Deimos floats above Hell itself!
You've never heard of anyone escaping
from Hell, but you'll make the bastards
sorry they ever heard of you! Quickly,
you rappel down to  the surface of
Hell.

Now, it's on to the final chapter of
DOOM! -- Inferno.
