The spider mastermind must have sent forth
its legions of hellspawn before your
final confrontation with that terrible
beast from hell. But you stepped forward
and brought forth eternal damnation and
suffering upon the horde as a true hero
would in the face of something so evil.

Besides, someone was gonna pay for what
happened to daisy, your pet rabbit.

But now, you see spread before you more
potential pain and gibbitude as a nation
of demons run amok among our cities.

Next stop, Hell on Earth!
