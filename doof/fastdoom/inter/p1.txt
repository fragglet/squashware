You gloat over the steaming carcass of the
Guardian. With its death, you've wrested
the Accelerator from the stinking claws
of Hell. You relax and glance around the
room. Damn! There was supposed to be at
least one working prototype, but you can't
see it. The demons must have taken it.

You must find the prototype, or all your
struggles will have been wasted. Keep
moving, keep fighting, keep killing.
Oh yes, keep living, too.
