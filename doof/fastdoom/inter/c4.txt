THE HORRENDOUS VISAGE OF THE BIGGEST
DEMON YOU'VE EVER SEEN CRUMBLES BEFORE
YOU, AFTER YOU PUMP YOUR ROCKETS INTO
HIS EXPOSED BRAIN. THE MONSTER SHRIVELS
UP AND DIES, ITS THRASHING LIMBS
DEVASTATING UNTOLD MILES OF HELL'S
SURFACE.

YOU'VE DONE IT. THE INVASION IS OVER.
EARTH IS SAVED. HELL IS A WRECK. YOU
WONDER WHERE BAD FOLKS WILL GO WHEN THEY
DIE, NOW. WIPING THE SWEAT FROM YOUR
FOREHEAD YOU BEGIN THE LONG TREK BACK
HOME. REBUILDING EARTH OUGHT TO BE A
LOT MORE FUN THAN RUINING IT WAS.
