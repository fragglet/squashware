You hear the grinding of heavy machinery
ahead. You sure hope they're not stamping
out new hellspawn, but you're ready to
ream out a whole herd if you have to.
They might be planning a blood feast, but
you feel about as mean as two thousand
maniacs packed into one mad killer.

You don't plan to go down easy.
