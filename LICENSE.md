I release all modifications to the original IWAD as public domain; where

It is my hope that Bethesda will look kindly upon this project as something
that both serves a practical purpose (providing a useful base for "It Plays
Doom! projects) and continues to promote their game.
I am not redistributing anything they have not already made available for
free to the public, nor am I making any money off this project.
